# SAP_Control-sequencer
This project modifies the SAP-1 microprocessor in Logisim-evolution by adding an automatic control sequencer for instruction cycles, a bootloader FSM for ROM-to-RAM loading, and an enhanced ALU supporting addition, subtraction, and 4x4-bit multiplication, improving automation and computational capability.
